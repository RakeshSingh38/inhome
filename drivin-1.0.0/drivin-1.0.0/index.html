<p>xt Summarizer
A text summarizer is an online tool that wraps up a text to a specified short length. It condenses a long article to main points.
The need for text summarizers is increasing day by day, because of time constraints.

People are looking for shortcut methods to learn ideas in lesser time. Even text summarizers are helping them to decide whether a book, a research paper, or an article is worth reading or not. 

Oxford defines summary as:

“a short statement that gives only the main points of something, not the details.”

Approaches in auto summarization:
Mainly two approaches have been developed over time for summarizing a long text into a shorter one.

Extraction Summarization:
This approach entails the method to extract keywords and phrases from sentences and then joining them to produce a compact meaningful summary.

Abstractive Summarization:
In this summary generator, algorithms are developed in such a way to reproduce a long text into a shorter one by NLP. It retains its meaning but changes the structure of sentences.

How does this text summarizer work?
Trained by machine learning, Paraphraser.io text summarizer uses the concept of abstractive summarization to summarize a book, an article, or a research paper. 

This summarize tool uses NLP to create novel sentences and generates a summary in which the main idea remains intact. It is an advanced-level tool that uses AI for its work. Therefore, the summary produced by this article summarizer tool appears to be flawless and inflow.

How to use our text summarizer?
Our summarizing tool is the best because it is simple to use and efficient also.

Insert the text (article, research paper, book extract) into the text area.
Or upload your content.
Click the “Summarize” Button. 
You can also toggle other features by selecting show bullets, best line, ranked base, and summary length.</p>
